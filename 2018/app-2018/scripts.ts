This was the story from 2017:

** some discussion about getting the RSVP page up and running **

[pause]

Charlene: Reasonably, is it possible to still make a game before Tomorrow morning?
Victor: haha
hahaha
Charlene: lol. nvm.

[5 hours & some discussions later]

Charlene: For the high score, is it a good idea to have people put "name" on the high score board

----
This game was lovingly made and programmed in under 10 hours
Thank to everyone involved
Sorry, Steph

AND NOW here is the story for 2018:

David: Well, we had one last year, so we should probably have a game this year as well
